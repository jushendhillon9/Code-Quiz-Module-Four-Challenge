Description: In this module challenge, I was instructed to program a basic coding quiz that had a smooth User Interface. The requirements for this quiz included a start button, a timer that began once the start button was clicked, and a page to save initials and the user's score. My coding quiz features a start button, quiz rules page, coding quiz page, and high scores page that are easy to navigate. The high scores page displays a list of high scores and features a button that can also wipe out the list of high scores. The color scheme for the quiz was also chosen to be aesthetically pleasing.
